## 📘 README.md – Employee-Department ORM Project

```markdown
# 🧑‍💼 Employee-Department ORM Project

This project demonstrates how to use SQLAlchemy to model and manage relationships between employees and departments in a MySQL database. It’s a simple yet effective example of one-to-many relationships using Python's ORM capabilities.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3.x  
- 🛢️ SQLAlchemy  
- 🐬 MySQL  
- 📦 pip / virtualenv

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `models.py` – Defines the `Employee` and `Department` classes with SQLAlchemy relationships  
- `database.py` – Sets up the MySQL connection and initializes the database  
- `main.py` – Populates the database and runs sample queries  
- `requirements.txt` – Lists required Python packages

## 🧠 Features

- Creation of `employees` and `departments` tables  
- One-to-many relationship between `Department` and `Employee`  
- Sample data insertion  
- JOIN queries to display employees with their respective departments

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adrian/employee-department-orm.git
   cd employee-department-orm
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your MySQL connection in `database.py`

4. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📌 Example Query

```python
session.query(Employee).join(Department).all()
```

## 📚 Learning Goals

This project is ideal for understanding how to:
- Define and manage relationships in SQLAlchemy  
- Perform JOIN operations using an ORM  
- Structure a basic Python project with database integration
